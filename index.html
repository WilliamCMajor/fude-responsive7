        <p>The Bayes theorem is a mathematical method used to calculate the conditional probability of events in probability and statistics. Based on past knowledge of the circumstances that might be important to the event, Bayes' theorem essentially describes the probability of an event occurring.</p>

        <p>The formula was discovered in 1763 by English statistician Thomas Bayes, who is honored as the theorem's namesake. It is regarded as the cornerstone of the unique Bayesian statistical inference method.</p>

        <p>In addition to statistics, Bayes' theorem is employed in many other fields, with medicine and pharmacology serving as two prominent examples. The theorem is very frequently used in various branches of finance. Modeling the risk of lending money to borrowers or predicting the likelihood that an investment will succeed are just a few uses.</p>
