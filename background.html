        <p>If you know something about statistics, you might hear of Bayes theorem, Bayesian probability, or Bayesian inference. All of these concepts stem from a paper proposed by Thomas Bayes.</p>

        <p>Thomas Bayes was born in 1702 in London England. He studies logic and theology at the University of Edinburgh. After graduating, he went back home to assist his father at church. And then, he became a minister at the Mount Sion Chapel. In his later years, he took a deep interest in probability. This amateur mathematician wrote a document. “An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances”. </p>

        <p>However, no one knew his mathematical theory until he died. Bayes dies before he has a chance to tell anyone what he’s been up to. His friend Richard Price discovered his notebooks in his apartment. Price is a pretty smart guy, so he instantly recognized the genius of his pal theory. In 1763, Price edited and developed the Bayes–Price theorem, and published it in Philosophical Transactions. He provided some of the philosophical basis of Bayesian statistics. </p>

        <p>In 1812, French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace developed the Bayes theorem and made it more applicable, known as conditional probability. It let you update your guesses with any new facts that might come your way.</p>
