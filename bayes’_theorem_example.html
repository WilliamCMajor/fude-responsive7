           <h3>Real life example:</h3>
           <p>In a study, physicians were asked what the odds of breast cancer would be in a woman who was initially thought to have a 1% risk of cancer but who ended up with a positive mammogram result (a mammogram accurately classifies about 80% of cancerous tumors and 90% of benign tumors.) 95 out of a hundred physicians estimated the probability of cancer to be about 75%. Do you agree?</p>

           <p><u><strong>Introduce the events:</strong></u><p>
           <p> + = mammogram result is positive, </p>
           <p>B = tumor is benign, </p> 
           <p>M = tumor is malignant.</p>
           <p>Note that B<sup>c</sup> = M. We are given P(M) = .01, so P(B) = 1 − P(M) = .99. We are also given the conditional probabilities P(+ | M) = .80 and P(− | B) = .90, where the event − is the complement of +, thus P(+ | B) = .10.</p>

           <p><u><strong>Solution:</strong></u><p>
           <p>
             \[P(M | +) = {P(+ | M)P(M) \over (P(+ | M)P(M) + P(+ | B)P(B))}\]
             \[= {0.80 × 0.01 \over (0.80 × 0.01 + 0.10 × 0.99)}\]
             \[= 0.075.\]
